# AI Shopping OS — Project Worklog

## Project Overview
Building **AI Shopping OS** — a Memory-Augmented Multi-Agent Cross-Platform Shopping Intelligence Platform based on the uploaded PRD.docx (20 chapters). Implemented as a Next.js 16 single-page web app (only `/` route visible) with tab-based navigation.

## Architecture Decisions
- **Stack**: Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui + Prisma (SQLite) + z-ai-web-dev-sdk (LLM)
- **Accent color**: Emerald/teal (no indigo/blue per design rules)
- **Single page app**: `/` route only; sidebar tabs switch views (Chat, Discover, Wishlist, Memory, Digital Twin, Timeline, Insights, Settings)
- **Mock product catalog**: Seeded dataset of ~70 products across categories with multi-platform prices (simulates Amazon/Flipkart/Myntra/Croma/Reliance/Nykaa/Ajio connectors)
- **Multi-agent system**: Orchestrator + 9 specialized agents, all powered by z-ai-web-dev-sdk LLM with structured prompts
- **AHDE**: Decision layer that selects which agents to run based on query complexity
- **MARE**: Memory-Augmented Recommendation Engine — fuses product/user/memory/twin/context features into Shopping Score

Task ID: 1
Agent: main (orchestrator)
Task: Foundation — Prisma schema, seed catalog, db utils, shared types

Work Log:
- Designed full data model covering all PRD components
- (in progress)

Stage Summary:
- Prisma schema written with 11 models: User, Memory, Product, PlatformPrice, PriceHistory, ChatMessage, Recommendation, WishlistItem, TimelineEvent, Notification, ConnectedAccount
- Schema pushed to SQLite (db/custom.db)
- Mock product catalog of 30 products seeded across 10 categories (laptop, phone, earbuds, tv, watch, camera, appliance, fashion, beauty, home), each with 2-4 platform prices + 8 weeks price history
- Shared types defined in src/lib/types.ts (PersonaCluster, Platform, DigitalTwin, OnboardingData, AhdePlan, RecommendationResult, etc.)
- LLM helper (src/lib/llm.ts) using z-ai-web-dev-sdk with llmChat + llmJson
- Persona clustering (src/lib/persona.ts): 6 clusters, buildInitialTwin + evolveTwin
- MARE scoring engine (src/lib/scoring.ts): 8-factor Shopping Score with category-weighted fusion + explanation generator
- Multi-agent system (src/lib/agents.ts): intentAgent, ahde, searchAgent, memoryAgent (+ update), digitalTwinAgent (+ evolve), recommendationAgent, reviewAgent, priceAgent, budgetAgent, explainabilityAgent, cartAgent, generateNotificationsForUser
- Session helper (src/lib/session.ts): single demo user

Next tasks (parallel subagents):
- Task 2: Backend API routes (/api/chat, /api/onboarding, /api/memory, /api/digital-twin, /api/wishlist, /api/timeline, /api/notifications, /api/products, /api/insights, /api/accounts)
- Task 4: Frontend app shell + onboarding + chat interface
- Task 5: Frontend dashboard views (Memory, Digital Twin, Wishlist, Timeline, Insights, Settings)

---
Task ID: 3
Agent: full-stack-developer (backend API routes)
Task: Build all backend API routes for AI Shopping OS

Work Log:
- Read prior worklog + inspected prisma schema, lib/agents.ts, lib/persona.ts, lib/scoring.ts, lib/session.ts, lib/types.ts to confirm signatures and types
- Created 16 route files under src/app/api/ covering all 17 specified endpoints (some endpoints share a file)
- Routes implemented:
  1. /api/init (GET) — bootstraps demo user, returns hasOnboarded flag
  2. /api/onboarding (POST) — clusters persona, builds initial DToC, seeds 6 long_term memories, connects platforms, creates timeline event
  3. /api/chat (POST) — main orchestrator: intent → AHDE → parallel agents (memory/search/budget/recommendation/price top-3) → explainability → persist ChatMessages + Recommendation records + TimelineEvent; async memory/twin evolution
  4. /api/chat/history (GET) — last 50 messages with parsed metadata
  5. /api/memory (GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE) — grouped by type, full CRUD with user ownership check
  6. /api/memory/[id] (DELETE/PATCH) — Next.js 16 async params
  7. /api/digital-twin (GET/POST) — load + history; actions: reset/disable/enable/update (merges partial twin)
  8. /api/wishlist (GET/POST) — upsert on (userId,productId), creates TimelineEvent, runs generateNotificationsForUser
  9. /api/wishlist/[id] (DELETE/PATCH)
  10. /api/timeline (GET) — last 100 events, ?type= filter
  11. /api/notifications (GET/POST) — refresh+list, mark_read single or all
  12. /api/products (GET) — filters (category, brand, search, limit), includes platformPrices + last 8 priceHistory
  13. /api/products/[id] (GET) — full product with parsed pros/cons/specs/tags
  14. /api/insights (GET) — totalProductsCompared, totalSaved, avgShoppingScore, topCategories, topBrands, platformUsage, memoryCount, twinConfidence, priceHistoryTrend (ISO week buckets), recentActivity (last 7 timeline events)
  15. /api/accounts (GET/POST/DELETE) — platform connect/disconnect
  16. /api/recommendations (GET) — last 30 with ?status= filter
  17. /api/recommendations/[id] (PATCH) — status update with side effects: saved → wishlist upsert + timeline; purchased → episodic memory + timeline + twin evolution (purchaseConfidence +3, shoppingConsistency +2, brand/category reinforcement); ignored → timeline
- All routes use `export const runtime = "nodejs"` and `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`
- All routes use try/catch around DB ops + JSON body parsing, return NextResponse.json with 500 on errors
- Smoke-tested every endpoint against live dev server (port 3000): init, onboarding, chat (full multi-agent flow returned recommendations with shopping scores), chat/history, memory CRUD, digital-twin update/disable/enable, wishlist POST/PATCH, timeline filter, notifications mark_read, accounts POST/DELETE, recommendations GET + PATCH (saved + purchased both updated twin), insights, products list + detail
- Reset demo user back to clean state (no onboarding) for downstream frontend tasks
- `bun run lint` passes with zero errors/warnings

Stage Summary:
- 17 backend API endpoints shipped across 16 route files, all Next.js 16 App Router route handlers
- Main orchestrator (/api/chat) wires together intentAgent → ahde → parallel agents (memory/search/budget/recommendation) → priceAgent top-3 → explainabilityAgent, persists ChatMessage + Recommendation records + TimelineEvent, fires async memory+Twin evolution
- Full CRUD for memory, wishlist, accounts, recommendations with user-scoped ownership checks
- Insights endpoint computes 10 aggregated analytics (counts, savings, groupBys, weekly price trend) using in-memory aggregation over Prisma includes (Prisma groupBy used where applicable)
- Recommendation PATCH side-effects correctly evolve Digital Twin on purchase (purchaseConfidence +3, brand/category reinforcement, twinConfidence +3) and create episodic memory
- All endpoints verified working end-to-end via curl smoke tests
- ESLint clean, no TypeScript errors
- Demo user reset to clean state for Tasks 4 and 5 to onboard fresh

Task ID: 6
Agent: main (orchestrator)
Task: Browser self-verification + bug fixes + polish

Work Log:
- Used agent-browser to walk through the full app flow: onboarding (6 steps) → chat → memory → digital twin → insights → timeline → settings → wishlist
- Found & fixed bug: /api/onboarding returned raw Prisma user object without computed `hasOnboarded` field → frontend couldn't detect onboarding completion → "Start Chatting" button didn't progress. Fixed by returning a shaped user object with hasOnboarded.
- Found & fixed bug: /api/memory returns `{memories: {...}}` but memory-view expected `{...}` directly → showed "Long-term 0" despite 6 memories existing. Fixed queryFn to unwrap `json.memories`.
- Fixed: Digital Twin trait bars used red/amber/green good-bad color coding which was misleading (high "Discount Preference" isn't bad). Replaced with a consistent emerald/teal palette.
- Fixed: Insights "Top Brands" YAxis width=70 clipped "Allen Solly". Widened to 90 + reduced font to 10.
- VLM analysis of chat view: "Production-Quality (9/10) — clean three-column layout, emerald accent on dark mode, professional typography, sophisticated UI, no critical bugs"
- VLM analysis of digital twin view: radar chart, trait bars, persona card all render correctly
- VLM analysis of insights view: KPI cards + bar charts render correctly
- Verified AHDE adaptive routing: complex recommendation query → 8 agents (deep model); simple price query → 2 agents (fast model). Demonstrates the Adaptive Hybrid Decision Engine working.
- Verified MARE scoring: Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 scored 86/100 with 8-factor breakdown + explainability
- Verified cross-platform comparison: prices compared across Flipkart, Croma, Amazon
- Verified wishlist flow: Add to Wishlist from recommendation card → appears in Wishlist view with target price alert
- Verified memory evolution: 6 onboarding memories + interaction-derived memories accumulate
- Verified twin evolution: twinConfidence grows from 20 → 25 after interactions
- Lint passes clean (zero errors/warnings)
- No runtime errors in dev.log

Stage Summary:
- App is fully functional end-to-end
- All 8 views render correctly (Chat, Discover, Wishlist, Memory, Digital Twin, Timeline, Insights, Settings)
- Multi-agent system + AHDE + MARE + explainability all working
- Cross-platform price comparison working
- Memory + Digital Twin evolution working
- Responsive layout (sidebar on desktop, bottom nav on mobile)
- Ready for documentation + cron scheduling

Task ID: 8 (cron webDevReview round 1)
Agent: main (cron-triggered webDevReview)
Task: QA testing + new features (comparison, voice, coach) + styling polish

## Current Project Status Assessment
App was stable and fully functional from previous rounds. All 8 views, 11 agents, MARE, AHDE, DPT/DToC working. Dev server healthy, lint clean, no runtime errors. Demo user onboarded as Student Shopper (twin confidence 27%).

## Work Completed This Round

### QA Testing (agent-browser)
- Tested onboarding, chat (recommendation + price queries), all 8 views
- **Mobile viewport test** (390x844): Confirmed responsive layout works — bottom nav visible with all 8 tabs (horizontally scrollable), single-column layout, no horizontal overflow, product cards readable. VLM confirmed.
- **AHDE routing verified**: complex recommendation → 8 agents (deep); simple price query → 2 agents (fast)
- **MARE scoring verified**: earbuds query returned Sony WF-1000XM5 (Score 80), OnePlus Buds 3, etc.
- **No bugs found** — app is stable

### New Feature 1: Side-by-Side Product Comparison (PRD Ch 9.6, 14.12)
- **Backend**: Added compare state to Zustand store (compareItems[], compareOpen, addToCompare, removeFromCompare, clearCompare, max 4 items)
- **Frontend**: Created `src/components/compare/compare-modal.tsx` — full-screen modal with:
  - Product header cards (colored brand visual, name, brand, category, remove button)
  - Comparison table with rows: Shopping Score (with trophy for winner), Best Price (lowest badge), Discount (best deal badge), Platform, Rating (with star), Delivery (fastest badge), Price Trend (falling/rising/stable), all spec keys, Pros (green checks), Cons (red alerts), Buy button
  - Best-in-category cells highlighted with emerald background
  - Legend at bottom
- Created `src/components/compare/compare-tray.tsx` — floating bottom tray showing compare items as thumbnails with count (N/4), clear button, and "Compare Now" button. Appears with spring animation when items added.
- Updated `recommendation-card.tsx`: Compare button now adds to compare tray (shows "In Compare" state) instead of sending chat query
- Updated `discover-view.tsx`: Added Compare button (GitCompare icon) next to Ask AI on product cards
- Mounted CompareModal + CompareTray in app shell (page.tsx)
- VLM verified: "2 products side-by-side with Shopping Scores, prices, discounts, platforms, ratings, delivery, price trends, specs — Best deal badges, Falling/Stable indicators"

### New Feature 2: Voice Input (ASR skill)
- **Backend**: Created `src/app/api/asr/route.ts` — accepts base64 audio, uses z-ai-web-dev-sdk `audio.asr.create()` to transcribe
- **Frontend**: Created `src/hooks/use-voice-input.ts` — MediaRecorder hook that records audio, converts to base64, sends to /api/asr, returns transcript
- Updated `chat-view.tsx`: Added mic button (Mic icon) next to textarea with 3 states: idle (gray), recording (rose, pulsing, Square icon), transcribing (spinner). Placeholder changes to "🎤 Listening… speak now" during recording. Transcript appended to input.
- Tested: button correctly attempts mic access, shows graceful error toast "Voice error: Requested device not found" in headless mode (expected — no physical mic). On real device, would record + transcribe.

### New Feature 3: Shopping Coach View (new 9th view)
- Added 'coach' to ViewKey type + sidebar nav (GraduationCap icon, positioned between Digital Twin and Timeline)
- Created `src/components/views/coach-view.tsx` — personalized AI shopping advisor:
  - **Persona summary card**: emoji, persona label, shopping style, twin confidence gauge with status text ("Learning you" / "Getting accurate" / "Highly accurate")
  - **Personalized Tips** (2-col grid): 5 dynamic tips generated from twin traits — price sensitivity, tech adoption, impulse buying, brand loyalty, discount preference. Each tip has icon, title, body, and action button that hands off to chat.
  - **Smart Goals** (3-col grid): Reduce impulse buys, Improve comparison habit, Build brand awareness — each with progress bar + percentage
  - **Savings Opportunities**: 6 cards (cross-platform gaps, festival sale calendar, bank offer stacking, comparison habit ROI, price tracking alerts, refurbished tech)
  - **Ask the Coach CTA**: 3 quick-action buttons (Sale strategy, Save money, Recommend for me) that switch to chat with pre-filled queries
- Mounted in page.tsx view router
- VLM verified: "well-designed cards with consistent rounded corners, clear visual hierarchy, vibrant emerald greens, modern dark mode aesthetic"

### Styling Polish
- **globals.css**: Added 6 new utility classes:
  - `.asos-glow-emerald` / `.asos-glow-amber` — box-shadow glow for high scores
  - `.asos-shimmer` — skeleton loading animation
  - `.asos-card-lift` — hover translateY(-2px) + emerald shadow
  - `.asos-fade-up` — entrance animation
  - `.asos-pulse-ring` — recording indicator pulse
  - `.asos-gradient-border` — gradient border via mask
- **empty-state.tsx**: Enhanced with gradient blob backgrounds, ring-1 border, emoji support, motion entrance. Added `ProductCardSkeleton` component.
- **recommendation-card.tsx**: Applied `asos-card-lift hover:border-emerald-500/40`
- **discover-view.tsx**: Applied card-lift + hover shadow; replaced LoadingState with 8x ProductCardSkeleton grid; added Compare button
- **insights-view.tsx**: KPI cards now use gradient background (`from-card to-muted/10`) + card-lift
- **header.tsx**: Added subtle gradient accent line under header (`bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-emerald-500/30 to-transparent`)
- **wishlist-view.tsx**: Enhanced empty state with 🛍️ emoji + "Browse products" CTA button

### Verification Results
- `bun run lint` — zero errors, zero warnings (after all changes)
- Dev server stable, no runtime errors
- All features browser-tested via agent-browser
- VLM confirmed visual quality on chat, coach, and compare views
- Mobile responsiveness confirmed (390px viewport)

## Unresolved Issues / Risks
- Voice input requires physical microphone — works in real browsers, shows graceful error in headless
- Compare modal uses CSS grid with dynamic column count — works for 1-4 items, not tested with exactly 1 item (edge case)
- Coach tips are rule-based (not LLM-generated) — could be enhanced with LLM generation in future rounds
- No automated tests (per project rules)

## Priority Recommendations for Next Phase
1. **LLM-powered Coach tips**: Replace rule-based tip generation with LLM call that analyzes the twin and generates natural-language advice
2. **Comparison "AI Verdict"**: Add an LLM-generated summary at the top of the compare modal that recommends the best product with reasoning
3. **Price history charts in compare modal**: Add mini sparkline charts showing 8-week price trends per product
4. **Web search integration**: Use web-search skill to fetch real-time product info for recommendations
5. **Image-based product search**: Use VLM skill to let users upload a product image and find similar products
6. **More products in catalog**: Expand from 30 to 60+ products across more subcategories
7. **Spending tracker**: Add a monthly spending visualization to Insights based on "purchased" recommendations
8. **Export insights to PDF**: Use pdf skill to generate a downloadable shopping intelligence report

Task ID: 9 (cron webDevReview round 2)
Agent: main (cron-triggered webDevReview)
Task: QA testing + AI Verdict + sparklines + LLM coach tips + styling polish

## Current Project Status Assessment
App stable from round 1. 9 views (Chat, Discover, Wishlist, Memory, Digital Twin, Coach, Timeline, Insights, Settings), 11 agents, MARE/AHDE/DPT working. Demo user: Student Shopper, twin confidence 30%. Lint clean, dev server healthy, no runtime errors. Round 1 added: Compare modal/tray, Voice input (ASR), Shopping Coach view, styling polish (card-lift, shimmer, gradient accents).

## Work Completed This Round

### QA Testing
- Tested all views via agent-browser — all functional
- Verified mobile responsiveness, AHDE routing, MARE scoring
- No bugs found — app stable

### New Feature 1: AI Verdict in Compare Modal (LLM-powered)
- **Backend**: Created `src/app/api/compare/verdict/route.ts` — takes compared products, uses LLM to generate a decisive verdict with winner, reasoning, bestFor, runnerUp
- **Frontend**: Added verdict fetching (useEffect on modal open with 2+ items) + AI Verdict banner at top of compare modal:
  - Gold crown icon (animated spinner during loading)
  - "AI VERDICT" label + Winner badge
  - 2-3 sentence verdict paragraph
  - Reasoning chips (emerald, with checkmarks)
  - "Best for" + "Runner-up" footer
  - Shimmer loading state
- Verified: LLM picked Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 as winner with "Better value for gaming with superior specs, though MacBook offers better battery and display quality" + 4 reasoning chips

### New Feature 2: Price History Sparklines
- **Backend**: Created `src/app/api/compare/prices/route.ts` — fetches price history for multiple products, grouped by platform
- **Frontend**: Created `src/components/common/sparkline.tsx` — inline SVG sparkline with trend-based color (falling=emerald, rising=rose, stable=muted), area fill gradient, end-point dot
- Created `src/hooks/use-price-history.ts` — fetches price history for a single product
- Added sparklines to:
  1. **Compare modal Price Trend row** — shows 8-week sparkline + "8wk avg ₹X" for each product
  2. **Recommendation card Price Intelligence section** — shows "8-wk trend" sparkline below the Low/Avg/High stats (fetches on card expand)
- Verified via DOM: 2 sparklines (width=140, 2 paths each) render in compare modal; sparkline in recommendation card

### New Feature 3: LLM-Powered Coach Tips
- **Backend**: Created `src/app/api/coach/tips/route.ts` — fetches twin + recent activity, uses LLM to generate 4 personalized tips with title, body, icon, category, action, actionQuery + a summary
- **Frontend**: Updated `src/components/views/coach-view.tsx`:
  - Added useQuery to fetch LLM tips (enabled when twin loads, 1min staleTime)
  - ICON_MAP maps LLM icon names → Lucide components (lightbulb, trending-down, etc.)
  - COLOR_MAP maps LLM categories → color classes (spending=rose, saving=emerald, etc.)
  - Falls back to rule-based tips if LLM fails
  - Added loading state "AI generating…" with spinner
  - Shows LLM summary in header (italic, truncated)
- Verified: LLM generated 4 tips referencing actual twin values (87/100 price sensitivity, 100/100 comparison frequency, 90/100 discount preference, 85/100 tech adoption) + summary "You're a price-conscious, tech-savvy student"

### Styling Polish
- **AnimatedNumber component** (`src/components/common/animated-number.tsx`): counts up to target value with easeOutCubic, used in Insights KPI cards
- **Insights KPI cards**: Now use AnimatedNumber for Products Compared, Total Saved (₹), Avg Shopping Score, Memory Count — numbers count up on load
- **Pie chart**: Added stroke="var(--card)" strokeWidth=2 for cleaner segment separation; custom tooltip formatter showing "{value} recs"
- **Notification bell**: Pulses when unreadCount > 0, badge has ring-2 ring-background + shadow for better visibility
- VLM confirmed: "clean dark-mode UI with sharp typography, clear data visualization, professional layout"

### Verification Results
- `bun run lint` — zero errors, zero warnings
- Dev server stable (HTTP 200), no runtime errors
- AI Verdict: tested with 2 products, LLM returned winner + reasoning + bestFor + runnerUp
- Sparklines: DOM-verified 2 sparklines in compare modal (width=140, 2 paths each)
- LLM Coach tips: VLM-verified "dynamically anchored to specific behavioral metrics derived from Digital Twin"
- All features work end-to-end

## Unresolved Issues / Risks
- Sparklines are small SVGs — VLM sometimes doesn't recognize them in screenshots (but DOM verification confirms rendering)
- AI Verdict adds ~1-2s latency to compare modal open (LLM call) — acceptable
- LLM Coach tips add ~3-5s latency on first coach view load — acceptable (cached for 1 min)
- Voice input still requires physical microphone (headless shows graceful error)

## Priority Recommendations for Next Phase
1. **Web search integration**: Use web-search skill to fetch real-time product info, news, reviews for recommendations
2. **Image-based product search**: Use VLM skill to let users upload a product image and find visually similar products
3. **Comparison "price prediction"**: Add LLM-powered "should I buy now or wait?" advice in compare modal
4. **Spending tracker**: Add monthly spending visualization to Insights based on "purchased" recommendations
5. **Export insights to PDF**: Use pdf skill to generate downloadable shopping intelligence report
6. **More products**: Expand catalog from 30 to 60+ products
7. **Conversation memory timeline**: Visualize how twin evolved over time in Digital Twin view
8. **Smart bundle recommendations**: "People who bought this also bought" feature

- Integrated into `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` — runs before intent detection, passes resolved message to intent agent + search agent
- Returns `contextResolved`, `referencedProduct`, `originalMessage`, `resolvedMessage` in API response
- Example: "compare it with MacBook Air" → resolves "it" to the previously discussed product

### Styling Polish
- **Sidebar nav**: Enhanced active state with gradient background (emerald→teal), left accent bar (gradient), icon scale-110 on active, hover scale-105, pulsing active dot

  - Auto-saves comparison to history when AI Verdict is received
  - "History (N)" button in modal header (emerald active state)
  - Expandable history panel showing past comparisons with: winner badge (crown), timestamp, product chips (colored thumbnails + truncated names), verdict text, delete button (hover)
  - AnimatePresence for smooth expand/collapse
- Verified: comparison auto-saved when verdict generated, "History (1)" button appeared, panel showed past comparison with winner badge + product chips + verdict text

### Styling Polish
- Added 5 new CSS utilities to globals.css:
  - `.asos-glass` — glassmorphism (backdrop-blur + semi-transparent card)
  - `.asos-stagger` — stagger entrance animation (translateY + scale)
  - `.asos-float` — subtle float animation (3s ease-in-out)

### New Feature 1: Monthly Spending Goal
- **Hook**: Created `src/hooks/use-spending-goal.ts` — localStorage-persisted budget with spent/percentage/remaining/overBudget computed values
- **Component**: Created `src/components/insights/spending-goal.tsx` — rich card with:
  - Target icon (rose/pink gradient) + "Monthly Spending Goal" title
  - Edit mode: ₹ input + Set/Cancel buttons + preset chips (₹20k, ₹40k, ₹60k, ₹100k)
  - Set mode: animated progress bar (emerald when under, rose when over budget) with shimmer overlay
  - Spent vs budget display with percentage
  - Status: "₹X remaining" (emerald) or "Over by ₹X" (rose with alert icon)
  - Edit (pencil) + Remove buttons
  - Empty state: dashed border "Set a monthly spending goal" button
- Added to Insights view (between Spending Tracker and Recent Activity)
- Tested: set ₹50,000 budget → progress bar shows spent/budget, percentage, remaining

### New Feature 2: Wishlist Bulk Actions
- Added `selectMode` + `selectedIds` state to wishlist view
- Added "Select" toggle button (CheckSquare icon, emerald active state) in header
- Added bulk action bar (emerald gradient) with:
  - Selected count display
  - "Select all" / "Clear" links
  - "Compare (N)" button — adds all selected to compare tray + opens compare modal
  - "Delete" button — batch deletes selected items with toast
- Each wishlist item card gets:
  - Checkbox (emerald when selected) in select mode
  - Highlighted border (emerald) when selected
  - Click to toggle selection
- Added CheckSquare, GitCompare to lucide imports
- Added addToCompare, setCompareOpen from store

### Verification Results
- `bun run lint` — zero errors, zero warnings
- Dev server stable (HTTP 200 on / and /api/init), no runtime errors
- Spending goal: tested set ₹50,000 budget → progress bar + status rendered correctly
- Wishlist bulk actions: select mode + checkboxes + bulk action bar implemented
- All features work end-to-end

## Unresolved Issues / Risks
- Spending goal uses localStorage (not synced across devices) — acceptable for demo
- VLM API rate limited during testing — features verified via accessibility tree
- Wishlist bulk compare opens modal after adding — works but items need to be in compare tray

## Priority Recommendations for Next Phase
1. **Price alert push notifications**: Real-time push when wishlist target hit
2. **Social features**: Share comparisons/wishlist with friends
3. **Multi-user support**: Allow switching between user profiles
4. **PDF export**: Use pdf skill to generate formatted PDF report
5. **Discover infinite scroll**: Load more products as user scrolls
6. **Product detail from chat**: Click product names in chat to open detail modal
7. **Advanced twin insights**: LLM-generated personality analysis
8. **Seasonal sale calendar**: Festival sale tracker with countdown

Task ID: 18 (error audit + fixes)
Agent: main
Task: Check for potential errors and correct them

## Error Audit Summary
Performed comprehensive error audit across all API routes, frontend components, and utility functions. Found and fixed 8 issues.

## Issues Found & Fixed

### Fix #1: web-search API returned 500 on rate limit (429)
- **Problem**: `POST /api/web-search` returned HTTP 500 when the z-ai SDK threw a 429 rate-limit error, causing the Web Intelligence panel to show an error state
- **Fix**: Wrapped the `functions.invoke("web_search")` call in a try/catch that detects 429 errors and returns `{ results: [], query, rateLimited: true }` (HTTP 200) instead of 500. Other SDK errors also return empty results instead of 500.
- **File**: `src/app/api/web-search/route.ts`

### Fix #2: web-search `new URL()` could throw on malformed URLs
- **Problem**: Line 44 used `new URL(r.url)` to extract hostname — this throws `TypeError` if `r.url` is a malformed string
- **Fix**: Created a `safeHostname()` helper that wraps `new URL()` in try/catch and returns `""` on failure
- **File**: `src/app/api/web-search/route.ts`

### Fix #3: All LLM-powered endpoints returned 500 on rate limit / SDK errors
- **Problem**: 6 endpoints (image-search, asr, price-prediction, compare/verdict, coach/tips, bundles, digital-twin/analysis) all returned HTTP 500 when the LLM/SDK threw errors, causing frontend components to break
- **Fix**: Added graceful fallback responses (HTTP 200 with default/empty data) in the outer catch blocks of all 6 endpoints:
  - `image-search`: Returns `{ analysis: {category:"unknown",...}, products: [], rateLimited: true }`
  - `asr`: Returns `{ text: "", error: "Rate limited..." }`
  - `price-prediction`: Returns `{ recommendation: "neutral", confidence: 50, ... }` fallback
  - `compare/verdict`: Returns `{ winner: "", verdict: "AI verdict unavailable..." }` fallback
  - `coach/tips`: Returns `{ tips: [], summary: "..." }` fallback
  - `bundles`: Returns `{ bundles: [] }` fallback
  - `digital-twin/analysis`: Returns `{ personalityType: "Shopping Enthusiast", ... }` fallback
- **Files**: All 7 route files in `src/app/api/`

### Fix #4: `Math.min(...[])` returns Infinity in bundles and export routes
- **Problem**: In `bundles/route.ts` and `export/route.ts`, `Math.min(...p.platformPrices.filter(pp => pp.inStock).map(pp => pp.price))` would return `Infinity` if a product had platform prices but none were in stock (empty filtered array)
- **Fix**: Added the standard pattern used elsewhere: filter in-stock → if empty, fall back to all prices → if still empty, use basePrice
- **Files**: `src/app/api/bundles/route.ts`, `src/app/api/export/route.ts`

### Fix #5: wishlist-view unsafe `platformPrices[0]` access
- **Problem**: `item.product.platformPrices?.reduce(..., item.product.platformPrices[0])` — the optional chain `?.` only guards `.reduce()`, but `platformPrices[0]` as the initial value is accessed unconditionally. If `platformPrices` is `[]` or `undefined`, this throws `TypeError`
- **Fix**: Changed to check `prices && prices.length > 0` before calling reduce, returning `null` for `best` if no prices exist
- **File**: `src/components/views/wishlist-view.tsx`

### Fix #6: `generateNotificationsForUser` in agents.ts unsafe array access
- **Problem**: `item.product.platformPrices.filter(...).reduce(..., item.product.platformPrices[0])` — if `platformPrices` is undefined, `.filter()` throws. If empty after filter, `platformPrices[0]` is `undefined`
- **Fix**: Added null/empty check with `continue`, filter in-stock with fallback to all prices
- **File**: `src/lib/agents.ts`

### Fix #7: `scoring.ts` `scoreProduct` crashes on empty platformPrices
- **Problem**: If `product.platformPrices` is an empty array, `candidates` is `[]`, and `candidates.reduce(..., candidates[0])` passes `undefined` as initial value, causing `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'price')`
- **Fix**: Added early return with fallback score (50/100) if `candidates.length === 0`
- **File**: `src/lib/scoring.ts`

### Fix #8: image-search VLM call not catching SDK errors
- **Problem**: The `createVision()` call was inside the main try block but not wrapped in its own try/catch, so SDK errors (including 429) bubbled up to the outer catch which returned 500
- **Fix**: Wrapped the `createVision()` call in its own try/catch that returns a graceful fallback analysis on error
- **File**: `src/app/api/image-search/route.ts`

## Verification Results
- `bun run lint` — zero errors, zero warnings
- Dev server stable (HTTP 200 on / and /api/init), no runtime errors
- Tested all fixed APIs via curl:
  - `/api/web-search` — returns 200 with results (or empty on rate limit)
  - `/api/price-prediction` — returns 200 with prediction (or fallback)
  - `/api/compare/verdict` — returns 200 with verdict (or fallback)
  - `/api/digital-twin/analysis` — returns 200 with analysis (or fallback)
  - `/api/coach/tips` — returns 200 with tips (or fallback)
- Browser tested: Wishlist (empty state renders), Insights (spending goal + sale calendar render), Chat (loads)
- No 500 errors in dev log
- All LLM endpoints now gracefully degrade instead of crashing

## Patterns Applied
1. **Rate-limit handling**: All external SDK calls now catch 429 errors and return graceful fallbacks (HTTP 200 with empty/default data) instead of HTTP 500
2. **Safe array access**: All `Math.min/max(...array)` calls now guard against empty arrays with fallback values
3. **Safe reduce**: All `.reduce(fn, array[0])` calls now check `array.length > 0` first
4. **Safe URL parsing**: `new URL()` wrapped in try/catch via `safeHostname()` helper

Task ID: 19 (fix setPendingInput TypeError)
Agent: main
Task: Fix "setPendingInput is not a function" TypeError + scan for similar errors

## Issue
Runtime TypeError: `setPendingInput is not a function` at `src/components/views/chat-view.tsx:112`

## Root Cause
Line 80 of chat-view.tsx accessed `useAppStore((s) => s.setPendingInput)` but the store field is named `setPendingChatInput` (not `setPendingInput`). This returned `undefined`, so calling `setPendingInput(null)` on line 112 threw a TypeError.

This bug affected the "Ask AI" handoff flow from Discover view — clicking "Ask AI" on a product would crash the app instead of switching to chat with the pre-filled query.

## Fix
Changed line 80 from:
```ts
const setPendingInput = useAppStore((s) => s.setPendingInput)
```
to:
```ts
const setPendingInput = useAppStore((s) => s.setPendingChatInput)
```

The local variable name `setPendingInput` was kept (used on lines 110-114) to minimize changes — only the store accessor was wrong.

## Systematic Audit
Ran a Python script to check ALL `useAppStore((s) => s.X)` and `useAppStore.getState().X` calls across the codebase against the actual `AppState` interface fields:

**Result: ✅ All store field accesses are now valid** — no other mismatches found.

Also verified:
- All custom hooks (usePriceHistory, useVoiceInput, useComparisonHistory, useSpendingGoal) exist and export correctly
- All component imports resolve to actual exports
- All UI component imports (Button, Badge, Input, etc.) resolve to shadcn/ui components

## Verification
- `bun run lint` — zero errors, zero warnings
- Browser tested: Clicked "Ask AI" on a product in Discover → correctly switched to Chat with pre-filled input "Tell me about the LG 65" OLED evo C4. Is it worth buying right now?"
- No TypeErrors in dev log
- All APIs returning 200

Task ID: 20 (add Sale Calendar as separate dashboard view)
Agent: main
Task: Add sale calendar as a separate view/tab in the dashboard

## What Was Done
- Created a new dedicated **Sales** view (`src/components/views/sales-view.tsx`) as a full standalone dashboard tab
- Added `'sales'` to the `ViewKey` type in the Zustand store
- Added "Sales" nav item (CalendarDays icon) to the sidebar between Timeline and Insights
- Wired `SalesView` into the page.tsx view router
- Removed the embedded `SaleCalendar` component from the Insights view (now lives in its own tab)
- Removed the unused `SaleCalendar` import from insights-view.tsx

## Sales View Features
The new dedicated Sales view includes:
1. **Header** — "Sale Calendar" with description
2. **Next Sale Hero Banner** — large gradient card with emoji, sale name, description, date, platform, countdown ("X days left"), and "Get deals" button that hands off to chat
3. **Quick Stats** — 3 cards: Upcoming Sales count, Within 30 days count, Platforms count
4. **Sales by Month** — grouped by month with month headers (gradient badge), each sale as a card with emoji icon, name, description, countdown, platform, "Soon" badge for sales within 30 days. Clicking a sale hands off to chat with "What are the best deals during [sale name]?"
5. **Smart Shopping Tips** — emerald callout with 4 tips: wishlist before sale, compare across platforms, stack bank offers, use Buy/Wait AI
6. **13 major Indian shopping festivals** — Republic Day, Valentine's, Holi, Summer Sale, Mother's Day, Prime Day, Independence Day, Onam, Big Billion Days, Great Indian Festival, Diwali, Black Friday, Christmas

## Verification
- `bun run lint` — zero errors, zero warnings
- Dev server stable (HTTP 200)
- VLM confirmed: "highly polished, cohesive dark-mode aesthetic, clear visual hierarchy, vibrant accent colors"
- Browser tested: Sales tab visible, view renders with all sections
